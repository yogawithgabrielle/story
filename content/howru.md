## How are you? – I ask myself.

I feel like shit…

<u> Well, why do I feel like shit?</u> 
I don’t feel like I have a choice, I feel trapped and out of control. 
<u> How do I make myself feel better?</u> 
Numb my brain with television and use the endorphins from my daily walks to get by, it works for many, why not. 
<u> Why don’t I want to try? What do I feel held back by?</u>

Rules that I never agreed to but are ever present, the – *you must do this, behave like this, wear this, be pretty, own this, panic about this, be calm and complacent about this, respect these peoples wishes above your own, be polite.*
I feel held back by these limits that I realised I had at about 16; now 8 years later, I can’t sit here and complain about them anymore.
It comes down to <u> whom I want to be.</u>  Do I want to be the floaty young girl who seeks validation from external coordinates, or am I going to be the embodied woman, grounded in her bliss asking what she can give to the moment rather than what she can get.
Giving will get you more than taking ever could.
 
Living in Canada gave me a feeling of liberation. Freedom.

I was living the way I pleased. It felt like I had given myself a license to be myself, unapologetically. To me, being the truest version of myself meant being confident, independently thinking and acting and speaking for myself, working through the messes and challenges of life on my own, learning to reach out to people when I needed it and not feeling depleted or any less powerful for doing so. 
I did this by recreating my identity based solely on what I knew to be true about myself, without having to take into consideration what anyone else already thought of me, it’s secretly been one of my favourite things about travelling for forever. 
Let me present this thought to you though - *Is it really freedom if when you return you feel equally as bound?*

No, what I really need is to free myself here so I can build myself my own independent foundation on which I create my own platform for life rather than running from something that will never leave unless faced.
 
I’ve been dreading facing it all though.
I have been dreading the conflict until I realised something really important.

> *“As long as there are hippies there will be police and as long as there are police there will be hippies.” – Ram Dass.*

I finally understood what he meant in real life terms; as long as I create a resisting force there will always be something or someone there to resist.
So in order to free myself from all of which I am bound, I need not rebel against, I need not join them either, I just need to BE HERE NOW.
To be free in each moment (at this point in my life) means to be clearly aware of your environments effects on you and yours on it. 

*Nothing but kindness. Nothing but consciousness. Nothing but being here now, every moment of every day can relieve me of the internal conflict and external judgement.*

#### So, here are my tips based on my recent discovery.

1. Ask yourself the above underlined questions and be patient with yourself.

2. Write out all of your beliefs that you are aware of at this point in time and ask yourself if it feels good to live with this? Eg: does it feel good to believe I always have to please others?

3. Rather than going against what doesn’t feel good, think about what you can do to neutralise it? Eg: rather than always pleasing others, I am going to show them kindness in my own way, a way that doesn’t deplete my own happiness.
I can do this by –
4. Give yourself a break, this is tough work to do and its important you reward yourself, after getting through some sticky stuff, try to do something that make you feel light. Eg: listening to nice music, a yoga class on YouTube, a cuddle from a loved one, a run, some drawing. Whatever it is that feels right for you.
