It’s been no secret that my whole life I have often had unpopular opinions, of course when I was young I saw it as not fitting in or disobedience. 

Now days I like exploring objective truths, trying to understand the how’s and why’s, seeing where acceptance fits into challenging standard ways of being or thinking, basically I’m just another being trying to understand the rules that bind us together amongst the variables of our lives.

Here are some of my thoughts, please note that I don’t view any of these as rules or principles for my life, merely an expression of what’s going on for me at the time of writing it.

My wish is that by sharing it, we can untangle a web, cement a feeling, change our perception or understand ourselves better in order to understand the world around us... I’m using this platform to express my need to feel as though I have an impact, but it’s together that we create change 💛
