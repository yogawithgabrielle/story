I say this as though it’s factual, what I mean by it is far from a fact and much closer to an unproven theory. 
It’s within my nature to question things, another thing I like to do is form opinions that aren’t popular, like many people I find satisfaction from from having unique thoughts, ideas and beliefs. 
I often spend unreasonable amounts time thinking about things the general population do, in the hope to discover an alternative, usually to do with behaviour or a thinking pattern. 
Eventually, I come up with something I believe to be unique to me, something I’ve thought of that could enhance my own life, if I’m not already, I’ll try to practice it, and then preach preach preach. 
The thing is though, someone, somewhere, already knows this, has already thought this, has already lived this, may have even written a book about it. I believe we are all connected, I’ve word for word, quoted beautiful souls who lived long before me without the knowledge of them ever saying it, that doesn’t make it any less of a discovery. 
It’s not so much that I’ve discovered something new, as my awareness has increased to include this new theory. 
It was always there, it has always been in place, my noticing it doesn’t make it original. 
What it does show is links between every being and the universe. Any being who is on the same life path will eventually come to realise the same things about their reality, it’s my intention, along with many others to extend that awareness to as many people as we can. 
Even though our thoughts might not be totally unique to each individual, it’s still important what we do with them. 
Every being has a role to play in this magnificent yet crazy planet of ours. 
So I don’t take credit, for any of what I choose to share, but I do feel a responsibility to share it.
