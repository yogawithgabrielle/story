Itâ€™s been no secret that my whole life I have often had unpopular opinions, of course when I was young I saw it as not fitting in or disobedience. 

Now days I like exploring objective truths, trying to understand the howâ€™s and whyâ€™s, seeing where acceptance fits into challenging standard ways of being or thinking, basically Iâ€™m just another being trying to understand the rules that bind us together amongst the variables of our lives.

Here are some of my thoughts, please note that I donâ€™t view any of these as rules or principles for my life, merely an expression of whatâ€™s going on for me at the time of writing it.

My wish is that by sharing it, we can untangle a web, cement a feeling, change our perception or understand ourselves better in order to understand the world around us... Iâ€™m using this platform to express my need to feel as though I have an impact, but itâ€™s together that we create change ðŸ’›
